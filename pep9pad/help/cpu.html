<p>
With interactive use, the user controls the execution of a single CPU cycle.
The general process is to make the following settings:
<p>
1. <a href="#Memory">Initialize the memory values</a>
<p>
2. <a href="#Register">Initialize the register values</a>
<p>
3. <a href="#Control">Set the control signals</a>
<p>
4. <a href="#Clock">Enable the clock signals</a>
<p>
After making these settings, you can click the Clock button at the bottom of the CPU pane to see the effect of the cycle
on the state of the CPU.
Before clicking the Clock button, you may click the Copy to Microcode button, which
will insert a line of microcode text equivalent to your CPU pane settings into the microcode pane at the position of the text cursor.
See the section Microcode Use for further details of Copy to Microcode.

<h3><a name="Memory">1. Initialize the memory values</a></h3>
You initialize a memory value by clicking on the value cell in the memory pane on the left side of the main window.
Enter a one-byte value in hexadecimal then press Enter (Return) or click outside the cell.
The following figure shows the user entering the hexadecimal value 0xab in the cell at address 0x0001.

<p>
If you want to clear all the values in memory to all zeros select System->Clear Memory from the menu.

<h3><a name="Register">2. Initialize the register values</a></h3>
You initialize a register value by clicking on the register in the CPU pane.
Enter a two-byte value in hexadecimal then press Enter (Return) or click outside the register.
The following figure shows the user entering the hexadecimal value 0xabcd in the index register.
<p>

<p>
You can change the value of a NZVC status bit by clicking on the bit, which toggles its value between zero and one.
The following figure shows the V bit toggled from 0 to 1.

If you want to clear all the registers in the CPU to all zeros select System->Clear CPU from the menu.

<h3><a name="Control">3. Set the control signals</a></h3>
Each control signal is activated by a GUI widget on the right side of the CPU pane.
There are five kinds of control signals &mdash; register address signals, multiplexer signals,
the ALU function signal, the AndZ signal, and the memory read/write signals.
<p>
<h4>Register address signals</h4>
There are three register address signals &mdash; A, B, and C.
Each signal is five bits and accesses one of the 32 one-byte registers in the two-port register bank.
To set a register address signal, enter a decimal integer value in the range 0..31.
<p>
For example, the following figure shows a register address of 7 for A, 23 for B, and 7 for C.
Address 7 is the least significant byte of the program counter, and address 23 is the least
significant of ROM register M1, which has a value of 1.
<p>

<p>
 <h4>Multiplexer signals</h4>
 There are three multiplexer signals &mdash; AMux, MDRMux, and CMux.
 Each multiplexer control signal determines whether the output comes from the left input or the right input.
 A zero on a multiplexer control line sends the left input to the output, and a one sends the right input to the output.
 You set the control signal by clicking on the control signal box.
 Each click cycles through (1) zero, (2) one, and (3) no input, in sequence.
 <p>
 For example, the following figure shows the AMux control signal set to zero, which selects the left (yellow) input,
 and the CMux control signal set to one, which selects the right (blue) input.

 <p>
 <h4>The ALU function signal</h4>
 The ALU function signal is a single four-bit value that you enter as a decimal number.
 The above figure shows a value of one entered for the ALU function, which selects the A plus B function.
  <p>
  <h4>The AndZ signal</h4>
  The AndZ signal determines the function of the AndZ combinational circuit.
  If the AndZ signal is zero the circuit passes the Z output of the ALU through unchanged.
  If the AndZ signal is one the circuit performs the AND operation of the Z output of the ALU and current value of the Z bit.
  You set the AndZ control signal by clicking the control signal box as with the multiplexer signals.
  The following figure shows the AndZ signal set to one.
  <p>
  <img src="qrc:/help/images/andzsignal.png" alt="andzsignal" hspace=10 vspace=10>
  <p>
  <h4>The memory read/write signals</h4>
  The MemRead and MemWrite signals are either asserted or not asserted during a cycle.
  The corresponding value in the GUI widget is one or blank respectively.
  You set the value by clicking in the widget, which toggles the signal between one and blank.
  MemRead and MemWrite cannot be asserted simultaneously.
  The following figure shows MemWrite asserted.
  <img src="qrc:/help/images/memreadwrite.png" alt="memreadwrite" hspace=10 vspace=10>
  <h3><a name="Clock">4. Enable the clock signals</a></h3>
  There are seven clock signals &mdash; LoadCk, MARCk, MDRCk, CCk, VCk, ZCk, NCk &mdash; that
  are the clock inputs to the seven sequential circuits in the CPU  &mdash; the register bank,
  the memory address register, the memory data register, and the C, V, Z, and N status bits respectively.
  At the end of each cycle you can specify data to be clocked into one or more of these sequential
  circuits.
  Click the check box to specify that data is to be clocked into a sequential circuit.
  The following figure shows the MDRCk check box checked, which specifies that data will be clocked into
  the memory data register from the MDRMux at the end of the current cycle.
