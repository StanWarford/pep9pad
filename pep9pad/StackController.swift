    /* NOTE -- See memorytracepane and memorycellgraphicsitem in ../Ref, 
    the logic will be the same but there is quite a bit of Qt complexity 
    that will need to be ported over.  Makes sense to use bezier curves 
    for rendering, particularly because they'll look good no matter the 
    screen res.  Could programmatically generate the bezier curves using 
    an automated tool like PaintCode.
